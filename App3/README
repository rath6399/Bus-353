/************************************
Benton Garrett: You're on the right track here. I made the following changes:

1. Opened win1 on line 16
2. On line 46, the chosen backgroundColor must be in ''
3. In a couple spots, I had to change from the format of TI.UI.createTab (etcetera) to Ti.UI.createTab in order to run without errors
4. Added teaVerdict.add(options); on line 118

I was unable to get the colors and navigation tab to show up, but the app does open without errors with the above changes.

Good job so far!
